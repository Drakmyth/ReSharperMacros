Macros
------
The following macros are added to ReSharper by this plugin:

* Value of another variable with prefix added
* Value of another variable with prefix removed
* Value of another variable with suffix added
* Value of another variable with suffix removed
* Value of another variable in all upper case
* Value of another variable in all lower case

Issues
------
If you come across something that seems like a bug, please report it here. Make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure your report isn't closed as "Invalid":

* Search to see if someone else has already reported the bug. Duplicate reports just slow down getting things fixed.
* Include the ReSharperMacros.dll assembly version in your report.
* Include steps to reproduce the issue in your report. Screenshots or videos may also prove helpful.
* If you have a crash report, please include that too by copying it into a [Gist](https://gist.github.com) and including the link. Just dumping a crash report directly into your report will cause your report to be closed without review.

Feature Requests
----------------
Have an idea for a macro that would fit well in this plugin? Awesome! File an issue and detail your idea. Keep it succinct and on-point, and only one feature per request, or it'll get closed as "Invalid". Then we'll discuss your idea some and decide whether to implement it or not.
